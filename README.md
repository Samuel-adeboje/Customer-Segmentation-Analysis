## **2️⃣ Objectives**
✅ **Segment customers** based on demographic and behavioral data.

✅ **Analyze spending patterns** in relation to age, work experience, and family size.

## **3️⃣ Dataset Overview**
This dataset was obtained from **Kaggle** and includes various customer attributes such as:

📌 **Gender** - Male/Female

📌 **Ever Married** - Yes/No

📌 **Age** - Numeric

 ## **4️⃣ Data Preprocessing**

- Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing values in "Work Experience" and "Family Size" using median values.

- Feature Selection: Focused on Age, Work Experience, and Family Size in relation to Spending Score.

- Encoding: Categorical variables were transformed into numerical format.

---

## **5️⃣ Clustering Methodology**

- Used K-Means Clustering to segment customers.

- Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

  **Features used for clustering:**

- Age vs. Spending Score

- Work Experience vs. Spending Score

- Family Size vs. Spending Score

---

## **6️⃣ Cluster Interpretation**

Cluster 0: Low spending scores, often older customers or those with large families.

Cluster 1: Moderate spending scores, typically mid-aged professionals.

Cluster 2: High-spending young customers, possibly early-career professionals.

Cluster 3: Mixed spending behaviors with diverse demographics.
